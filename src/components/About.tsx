                <p>
                    Hey there! I'm Salah, a passionate and slightly sleep-deprived Full Stack Developer who’s been coding through chaos since 2018. Armed with a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Rathinam College of Arts and Science, I’ve been on a mission to make the internet a more functional (and better-looking) place, one website at a time.                </p>
                <p>
                    While most people were busy figuring out what they wanted to do in life post-college, I dove straight into the world of freelancing. Since then, I’ve been building everything from sleek business websites to complex web applications – all while juggling client demands, coffee cups, and occasional bugs that just wouldn’t die.                </p>
                <p>
                    I specialize in both frontend and backend development (because choosing just one side of the stack is boring), and I love delivering clean, user-focused designs with rock-solid code behind the scenes.

                    If you're looking for someone who can design, develop, debug, and deploy – with a bit of sarcasm on the side – then congratulations, you just found him.                </p>
